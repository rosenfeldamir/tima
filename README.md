3. **Research Sessions** - Perfect for managing multiple research papers or study topics
4. **Sprint Planning** - Use for time-boxed development sprints across features
5. **Meeting Prep** - Allocate time for preparing multiple meeting topics

## Customization

Want to change the default settings? Edit these values in `src/tima_timer/app_flet.py`:

```python
# Color scheme (lines 17-28)
COLORS = {
    'bg': '#1e1e2e',           # Dark background
    'primary': '#6c63ff',       # Primary accent color
    # ... customize other colors
}

# Default duration is stored in user data and can be changed via Settings menu
```

## Troubleshooting

### Timer not ticking?
- Ensure you have projects added
- Check if the current project is paused (look for [PAUSED] indicator)

### Sound notifications not working?
- Windows: Ensure `C:/Windows/Media/Alarm04.wav` exists
- macOS/Linux: Console notification will appear (audio support coming soon)

### Projects not saving?
- Check write permissions in the application directory
- Verify `tima_projects.json` is not corrupted
