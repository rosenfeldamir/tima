### Platform Notes
- **Windows**: Full support with native sound notifications
- **macOS/Linux**: GUI works, but sound notifications may need adjustment

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Focus Mode** - Pause all non-essential projects to focus on one task
2. **Daily Rotation** - Set up recurring daily projects and cycle through them
3. **Research Sessions** - Perfect for managing multiple research papers or study topics
4. **Sprint Planning** - Use for time-boxed development sprints across features
5. **Meeting Prep** - Allocate time for preparing multiple meeting topics

## Customization

Want to change the default settings? Edit these values in `tima.py`:

```python
self.default_duration = 3600  # Default duration in seconds (1 hour)

# Color scheme (lines 29-40)
self.colors = {
    'bg': '#1e1e2e',           # Dark background
    'primary': '#6c63ff',       # Primary accent color
    # ... customize other colors
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Timer not ticking?
- Ensure you have projects added
- Check if the current project is paused (look for [PAUSED] indicator)

### Sound notifications not working?
- Windows: Ensure `C:/Windows/Media/Alarm04.wav` exists
- Other OS: Modify `timer_ended()` function to use cross-platform audio

### Projects not saving?
- Check write permissions in the application directory
- Verify `tima_projects.json` is not corrupted
